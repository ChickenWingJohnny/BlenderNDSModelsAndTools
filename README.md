 # About This Page

![Example Render](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/842772043468242977/1219054419862229122/RushAnnounce.png?ex=662ed1e6&is=661c5ce6&hm=f3c0bbb3b3f59b9e0ce5cb4d5413755298b25dbab108c6b91239b7f1b674dc3d&)

So you wanna check out my models? Awesome! Just go ahead, download the repo, and import them to get started. However, before doing that, I'd recommend taking a look through this ReadMe. It's short, organized, and will only take like 5 minutes. 

Trust me, it will save you time! 

 ## Getting Started

As I said earlier, just download the source code, and you'll be more than set. However, please take note of these few things...
 ### Prerequisites

In order to utilize these models, you'll need to:
- Have Blender 4.0 or Higher installed, the models won't load otherwise.
- ***Credit me!*** While I didn't make these models, I put time and effort into making additional textures and the rigs. You can do this by either tagging me, and/or linking people back to this repo.
- Uhhhh be really cool I guess? (Which if you're reading this, you are btw, keep it up! :D) 
 ## Usage

You can use this for whatever project you'd want! Fangame, animation, whatever! My only request is that you credit me, and link back to here. Some of my various platforms are listed at the end of this ReadMe and my profile, do take a look!

### Blender Tutorial

The way these models work are really cool and the part of my methods that I used, particularly of the facial rig, was taught to me by the amazing [@TheSicklyWizard](https://www.youtube.com/@TheSicklyWizard) on Youtube. He's been making some FANTASTIC content over there, and I highly recommend his tutorials when it comes to his rigging series.

#### Custom Properties and Expressions

Let's take a deep dive into this screenshot here. On the right of the viewport, underneath the model LocRotScale info is the elusive **Custom Properties** channel... *oooOOOoooOooOooOoo*

You have nothing to be afraid of though!. Changing the expression is as simple as toggling the switches. But that's if you want a more direct approach. for a more intuitive approach, you can use the **Pose Library**.

#### Pose Library

Shift your attention to the bottom of the viewport, and you're met with all the possible expressions the character can pull off. In order to apply one, you'll need first be in pose mode and make sure no bones are highlighted beforehand. Just click on any expression you want to apply it. 

***NOTE THAT, in order to keyframe expressions for animation, you MUST have the EXRESSIONS Bone Group enabled, and make sure include the custom properties while keyframing.***

#### IK + FK Switch

Another cool feature of note is the IK/FK switch for each limb. You'll see a cross and inside it's custom properties, it should have a toggle for IK. Flip it for position based control. Unfortunately, I've yet to figure out position tracking for easy transitions between kinematics. *Remember that custom property keyframing still applies here.*

#### Wiggle Bones
The Quills and Ears all have wiggle bones by default for easy motion tracking. It uses the very popular [Wiggle2 Addon](https://github.com/shteeve3d/blender-wiggle-2), which I'd reccomend reading up on before utilizing. It requires movement in the timeline in order to work, and you can bake the physics into the animation from there.

### Tool Tutorial
To be made later...
